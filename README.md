## Folder explanation
./data/collecting contains one file that collets PPI data with API. 

./data/processed contains all processed files generated by ipynb files.  

./data/processing organizes by folders steps of data processing.  

./data/raw organizes by folder the raw data files used.  

./EDA organizes by partcipant the EDA related notebooks.  

./Erdos_milestone organizes by checkpoints the Erdos milestone notebooks.  

./model_training organizes by models the notebooks for model trainings.  

./proj_mod is the self created python module containing functions used accross files.  

## File naming explanation 
All ipynb files are named with format: 

[*task code*]_[*further explanations*].ipynb 

See following the *task code* and *task* correspondence: 

| task code | task explanation | 
|-----------|-------------------|
|DC01|Identify stable tech company (i.e. a tech compnay, classified with NAICS, maintaining sp 500 index status during a continuous period that we care)|
|DC02|Identify the NAICS codes that we consider tech industry| 
|DCO02|Collecting PPI data according to the NAICS chosen with API| 
|PD01|Created the *tech (stock) index*|
|PD02|Create proportional change of tech index| 
|PD03|Processing daily macro data, this includes fed rates and resource prices|
|PD04|Processing monthly macro data, this includes PPI data| 
|EDA|Doing EDA and playing around with the data| 
|PD05|Create main datasets, this includes creating the no inflation adjusted dataset and creating the inlfation adjusted dataset| 
|MTEBM|Training related files for Explanable Boosting Machine| 
|MTMARS|Training related files for Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines| 
|MTNN|Training related files for Neural Networks| 
|MTSPLINE|Training related files for Spline model|
