The original creation of function process_ppi_file() should be credited to Xiangyi Tao, and Thiago Brasileiro Feitosa. 
Yuan debugged and adjusted the function to create the PPI... files in data/processed with the function. 

The codes were originally included in PD03 (by mistake), Yuan moved them here into PD04.
